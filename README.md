# dipole-antenna
A 3D printed antenna for dual-band (2-meter / 70-centimeter) use.

## Notes
- For the wire I used, it is the equivalent of 3.6mm in diameter.  However, due to variances, 3.7mm is a better diameter to use if attempting to make something to enclose the elements.
- For my printer, I have to operate within a print size of 220x220x250mm (Creality Ender 3)

### About baluns / chokes
- "Since the goal is to eliminate common mode currents, it's much better to pass your feedline through a stack of ferrite cores (no coils). When I was having isolation issues on a UHF dipole I made, I found that about 5 clamp-ons made the difference."

- "You'll probably be fine, but coax baluns can be pretty narrow band depending on the characteristics of the antenna and feed line. If you have any trouble with RF in the shack, a clip on ferrite bead on either side of the balun should fix you right up, as those beads are quite effective on VHF and UHF (much less so on HF, bead baluns suck below 50MHz)."
